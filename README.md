o Output: A shortened URL (use only ten digits, 26 lowercase characters, 26 uppercase characters) of extra length 2 from a given link (example: applau.se/5s)

o Handle the case that the 2-character length is running out of choices by retiring the shortened URL that has not been called for the longest time
